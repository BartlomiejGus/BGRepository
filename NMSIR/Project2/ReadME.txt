The aim of the project was to create a fuzzy controller, which was to be used to control 
an inverted pendulum with a mass at the end. The fuzzy controller was tested on different scenarios:
- different starting position
- different starting deflection
- initial disturbance
The completed regulator has successfully passed all tests.
